description: "The Rust bindings of this repository's clean-code standard. Use when building or restructuring a Rust tool this repository owns (pns, uu, the herdr plugins): converting a crate into a Cargo workspace, drawing crate boundaries, choosing between a trait, an enum and a concrete type, picking a persistence crate, or running the Rust quality gates. Read the language-neutral method alongside it."

# Clean code: Rust

**Read `~/.agents/skills/clean-code/SKILL.md` first.** That skill carries the method: the
ordered ladder, the five module roles and their dependency direction, SOLID, the test obligations,
the delivery ladder, the sol review, and the completion report. This file states only how those are
spelled and enforced in Rust, and it wins wherever the two disagree on a number or a mechanism.

The Rust tools this repository owns today: `pns` (`pns`), `uu`
(`uu`), and the three herdr plugins, which live in their own repositories under
`webdavis` since 2026-09-17. The worked
example is [`PNS-EXAMPLE.md`](PNS-EXAMPLE.md), read from `webdavis/pns` at commit `e4632e8` on
2026-09-28.

## The owner's standards

These win over everything below where they differ.

- TDD (test-driven development): failing behavioral test, minimal implementation, refactor.
- SOLID (single responsibility, open/closed, substitutability, interface segregation, dependency inversion).
- DRY (don't repeat yourself), without speculative abstractions.
- Self-documenting code; comments only for non-obvious intent or safety.
- Production files should stay within 150 lines, never exceed 250. Separate test files. Split by cohesive
  domain responsibility.
- Idiomatic safe Rust: explicit ownership, typed errors, deterministic cleanup, bounded resources, and
  preserved privacy and durability.
- Unsafe is rare and fenced off:
  - Keep each unsafe block as small as possible, isolated in its own small module.
  - Every single block requires a one- or two-line `// SAFETY:` comment explicitly proving why undefined
    behavior is impossible.

## The workspace

The five roles are five crates in one Cargo workspace:

    crates/<tool>-domain
    crates/<tool>-application
    crates/<tool>-protocol
    crates/<tool>-adapters
    crates/<tool>-cli

**`Cargo.toml` is the enforcer.** A crate can only `use` what its own `[dependencies]` names, so an
inward dependency from domain or application code to a concrete adapter fails to compile rather than
passing review by luck. A declared cycle is refused by cargo outright.

The binary target keeps the tool's name (`[[bin]] name = "<tool>"`), because every caller invokes it
by that name. Keep `Cargo.lock` committed and build `--locked`.

`main.rs` targets 50 to 150 lines, preferably under 100, and must be below 150 at completion.

### What the domain crate excludes

Filesystem access, SQLite, TOML, JSON, HTTP, environment variables, process spawning, macOS APIs,
vendor APIs, executable discovery, and CLI output. Prefer `std`-only unless a small dependency is a
genuine domain primitive.

## Rust abstraction choices

- a **concrete type** when there is one implementation and no substitution need
- a **closure** for one injected operation such as a clock or a mapper
- a **trait** for a stable external capability or a meaningful contract
- an **enum** for a closed set of alternatives, which is how the neutral rule "make invalid states
  unrepresentable" is spelled here: replace conflicting boolean pairs with one enum
- a **newtype** for validated identifiers and sensitive values
- **generics** when compile-time composition improves clarity
- **`dyn Trait`** at the composition root's heterogeneous collections only

Do not create a trait for every struct, create one-method wrapper types merely for dependency
injection, use `Box<dyn Trait>` throughout domain code, introduce generic parameters that obscure the
use case, build a service locator, or hide branching inside macros to make files look shorter.

The destination interface:

    trait NotificationDestination: Send + Sync {
        fn id(&self) -> &DestinationId;
        fn capabilities(&self) -> DestinationCapabilities;
        fn deliver(&self, request: &DeliveryRequest) -> DeliveryOutcome;
    }

## Errors and outcomes

Do not use `Option` where several materially different failure or unknown states must be
distinguished for diagnostics or policy: use a typed `Result` or a purpose-built enum.

Do not panic on ordinary external failures. A panic is acceptable only for a compiled-in invariant
whose violation is a programmer error and cannot depend on operator input or runtime conditions.
Avoid `unwrap` and `expect` on untrusted input.

Do not add `Arc<Mutex<_>>` by default. First consider ownership, immutable sharing, message passing,
task confinement, or a transaction.

Do not introduce Tokio or another async runtime solely to make the architecture look modern. The
synchronous, deadline-bounded model is acceptable.

Isolate every `unsafe` block, test code included, in its own small module, keep the block as small as
possible, give each one a one- or two-line `// SAFETY:` comment proving why undefined behavior is
impossible, and add focused tests.

## Visibility

Private by default. `pub(super)` for narrow parent collaboration, `pub(crate)` for internal
cross-module collaboration, `pub` only for intentional crate APIs. Do not make the module tree public
so integration tests can reach it; curate exports in `lib.rs`.

## Persistence

Prefer synchronous `rusqlite` over an async database layer unless a runtime requirement proves
otherwise. WAL mode, versioned migrations, explicit transactions, bounded busy timeouts, restrictive
file permissions, typed codecs. **Every caller handles `SQLITE_BUSY` with a bounded timeout.**

Domain and application code must not depend on `toml::Value` or free-form plugin tables.

A crate that reaches outside its own folder with `include_str!` or an `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`
path join stops compiling the day the crate moves repositories. Keep the crate's tests against
fixtures it owns, and pin any generated-file equality from the outer repository instead.

## Tests

**New behavior is written test-first, without exception.** Write the failing test, run it under
`cargo test`, see it fail for the reason you intended, then make it pass. A pure move is exempt: it
owes a test that already pins the behavior, written before the move if none exists. The full rule,
and the mutation verification every fix owes after green, is in `clean-code/TESTING.md`.

Unit tests live beside their implementation under `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`. A large unit-test module
may live in a private child file (`src/lights/schedule.rs` beside `src/lights/schedule/tests.rs`);
that is still `cfg(test)` and does not enter production builds.

**Tooling that exists, and tooling that does not.** `cargo-mutants` and `cargo-fuzz` are **not
installed**: mutation testing is done by hand, per behavior, against an unmutated control, and the
table goes in the report. Every crate pins `channel = "stable"` in its own `rust-toolchain.toml`, so
a plain `cargo` call runs stable whatever rustup's default is. `cargo-miri` **is** installed, on a
nightly that has to be asked for by name: run it as `cargo +nightly miri`. CI is stable macOS, so
**Miri results are local evidence, never a CI gate**. Add `proptest` only after naming the input
space it covers better than examples do.

`cargo test --workspace` runs crates in parallel competing for the same CPU, so measure the speed gate
under that configuration.

## Quality gates

pns, uu, damnit, lights and herdr-damnit run their gates with `just gates`. A repository without that recipe runs the cargo lines below.

    just gates
    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    cargo check --workspace --all-targets
    cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
    cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast
    RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps

Plus the builder's own cargo line and every dependent sibling's test command. Do not add broad lint
suppressions; a `#[allow]` must be narrow and explain why the lint is wrong at that location.

## The file-size command

Count physical lines after `rustfmt`, with this command and no other. `tokei` mis-parses this tree:
its totals fall thousands of lines short of `wc -l`.

    git ls-files '<crate-path>/*.rs' | while IFS= read -r f; do
      awk -v F="$f" '
        /^[[:space:]]*#\[cfg\(test\)\]/ && !seen { seen = 1 }
        !seen { impl++ }
        { total++ }
        END {
          if (F ~ /(^|\/)tests(\.rs|\/)/) impl = 0
          printf "%5d impl %5d total  %s\n", impl, total, F
        }' "$f"
    done | sort -k3,3rn

Implementation lines are those before the first `#[cfg(test)]`; a file named `tests.rs` or under a
`tests/` directory has zero. **A `#[cfg(test)]` item above production code is itself a finding**, not
a way to shrink the number.

Limits, per the owner's standing rule: production files stay within 150 implementation lines and never
exceed 250. Test files live apart from production code and stay under 400 total lines, with no
handwritten `.rs` file over 500.
