description: >-
  Run a slice from a plan or spec through the full pipeline, where findings may leave as tasks
  that outlive the pull request. Use when starting plan-derived work, when a task says
  Strategy-A, or when the user says "/strategy:open-loop".
---

# Open-loop

**The loop is OPEN because findings can leave it.** A review here may file a task that outlives this
pull request, and this is the only strategy allowed to create future work. Its sibling
[closed-loop](../closed-loop/SKILL.md) feeds every finding back into the same iteration instead, and
that difference is the primary one between them.

## When to use this

The work came from the plan or the spec, and you are willing for some of what the reviews find to be
scheduled rather than fixed now. If the work exists BECAUSE an earlier review found something, you want
[closed-loop](../closed-loop/SKILL.md). Decide when the TASK IS CREATED and write it in the task
description, so it is never a judgement call later.

Every step runs. Tasks filed at step 8 then run [closed-loop](../closed-loop/SKILL.md), which cannot
file tasks of its own, and that is what keeps the tree exactly two levels deep and provably finite.

**This was called Strategy-A**, and every ledger, checklist and memory in this repository still says
`A`. Both verifier scripts still take the letter, so pass `A` to them.

Read [the ledger grammar](../../ledger-grammar.md) before ticking anything: it carries the two verifier
scripts, what counts as evidence, the verdict rule, the register's dispositions, and how to record a
deviation.

## Open both ledgers at step 1, before any code exists

```bash
~/.claude/pipeline/slice-checklist.sh  new <slug> A [--security] [dir]
~/.claude/pipeline/findings-register.sh new <slug> A [dir]
```

## The assumptions ledger, before any question is asked

Step 1 reads the plan and the spec, and most of what it needs is already answerable from the tree. Write
down what you concluded as a NUMBERED ledger and present it as ONE batch before asking anything:

```markdown
## Assumptions ledger

Confirm all, or name the numbers to change. Anything you do not name I treat as confirmed.

1. <assumption>, source: <path:line, spec section, plan line, or convention>
```

Every entry cites where it came from, measured the way step 2 measures the brief:
`git show origin/main:<path> | grep -n`, never a working copy. An assumption with no source is a question
wearing a statement's clothes, so ask it instead of listing it.

A REJECTED assumption becomes a question, asked one at a time, naming what it changes about the brief. A
confirmed one enters the brief as a stated premise, which is what gives step 2 something to falsify. The
ledger is presented ONCE, because dripping the same content out as individual questions is the waste it
exists to prevent.

Despite the name it is not one of the two verifier ledgers above, and no script reads it. This ledger
and the argument log below are both adapted from chaseai-yt/claudex-loop, MIT.

## The steps

| #    | step                                                                    | leaves         |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1    | Read the plan AND the spec, write the brief, and LOG it                 | brief path     |
| 2    | Review the BRIEF, before any code exists                                | quoted verdict |
| 3    | Implement: test-first, mutation-verified against an unmutated control   | commit sha     |
| 4a   | Review correctness, validator agreement, shell safety                   | quoted verdict |
| 4a-s | Review the SECURITY lens (security slices only)                         | quoted verdict |
| 4b   | Review test quality: can each assertion FAIL. Own worktree; FIXES       | quoted verdict |
| 4c   | Independent read by the orchestrator                                    | notes path     |
| 5    | Adjudicate: REPRODUCE every finding before accepting it                 | register rows  |
| 6    | Fix 4a and 4c findings only; 4b already closed its own                  | commit sha     |
| 7    | Re-review the fix, EXACTLY ONCE. Never a loop                           | quoted verdict |
| 8    | Open findings become follow-up TASKS; ratchet the step-0 corpus         | task numbers   |
| 9    | Gates, push, verify the ref landed, open PR, merge                      | PR number      |

Step 1 must not happen in the same action as step 3. The log line is what creates the gap for step 2 to
happen in; without it step 2 is not skipped by choice, it is unreachable.

Step 2 catches a stale or false brief for free, before anyone builds against it. A brief is a
HYPOTHESIS, not a fact: verify each of its claims against the tree rather than obeying it, and say so
when it is wrong. Every file and line number it cites is re-measured with
`git show origin/main:<path> | grep -n`, never against a working copy or a sibling worktree, because
several stale addresses in a row all traced back to measuring in the wrong tree.

Step 3 ships a DIFFERENTIAL test when the slice models an external tool's behaviour: a corpus run
through the real binary, asserting our reading matches its reading. Not a list of cases someone thought
of. Where you can ask the real tool instead of modelling it, do that and skip the problem entirely.

Steps 4a and 4b run in PARALLEL and 4b MUTATES production code, so give each its own worktree. Sharing
one produces false SURVIVED results, which is the dangerous direction: it reads as a coverage gap, so
the next round is briefed to plug a hole that does not exist.

Step 4b needs a CONSTRUCTED lens, not just a fresh instance. Name the mutation classes to attempt:
revert the fix itself, weaken each guard's precision rather than deleting it, delete a message or a
status while leaving behaviour intact, replace a helper with the naive thing a future editor would
write, break the exemptions and confirm the CLEAN fixtures fail. Require a table of mutation, outcome,
and WHICH assertion killed it. A kill with no named assertion is not a kill, and every sweep runs an
UNMUTATED CONTROL, because a broken harness reports every mutation identically.

Every review charter (2, 4a, 4a-s, 4b, 7) ends with a CODE QUALITY section, reported separately and
ranked BELOW correctness, so a SOLID nit never outranks a missed defect. Adjudicate a quality finding
the same way as a correctness one: fix it, or accept it with a written rationale.

## Who runs each

The verifier prints a WHO column and does NOT enforce it, and that column is stale (it still says Opus
implements, sol at max, Fable at xhigh). The live roster is `pipeline-model-allocation.md` in this
project's memory directory; read it if the two disagree. As of the 2026-09-01 ruling:

- 1, 4c, 5, 8, 9: the orchestrator.
- 2, 4a-s, 4b: Fable, reached by INHERITANCE only. Never pass `model:"fable"`; that override is
  entitlement-gated and falls back to Opus silently, with no error.
- 3, 6: an implementer subagent (`model:"sonnet"`).
- 4a, 7: sol at ultra, and the redirect matters:

  ```bash
  codex exec -m gpt-6-astra -c model_reasoning_effort=ultra -c approval_policy=never \
    -s read-only -C <repo> -o <out> "<prompt>" </dev/null
  ```

  Without `</dev/null` it waits on stdin forever.

The principle outlives any particular model. Whoever implements never reviews their own work. 4b must be
write-capable, so it can never be sol, which runs read-only and structurally cannot mutation-test.
Authentication and credential subject matter goes to Fable, because sol's runtime refuses it outright
regardless of wording, and rewording does not help.

Dispatch each step EXACTLY ONCE, and check for an agent already running it before dispatching. Two
agents on one step race the worktree. Once 4b is dispatched on a worktree the implementer is done: route
any late refinement to 4b, which fixes in place, and never message the implementer about that slice
again.

Retry an assigned reviewer ONCE, then substitute a write-capable agent and record the deviation. Never
merge with a review step simply missing. "The run died" needs positive evidence: an error marker, a
refusal string, or a process exit plus an empty file on a SECOND check after a settling delay. An empty
file on first check is the normal state of a run in progress.

## Reviews stay inside the slice's own diff

Every review charter states the diff under review (`git diff origin/main...HEAD`) and requires findings
to anchor to a line it ADDED or CHANGED. A defect in code the slice merely calls is out of scope unless
the slice made it reachable or made it worse. A pre-existing defect the slice WIDENS is in scope only up
to the widening, and the remedy is the smallest change that restores the pre-slice blast radius.

A reviewer that happens to see an out-of-scope defect NAMES it in a separate "observed, out of scope"
section carrying no disposition. Those never enter the register, and the reconciliation counts only
in-scope findings.

## The argument log

Each review round appends to `argument-<slug>.md`, beside the checklist and the register in the same
directory. No script creates it and no gate reads it. The first append creates it, and it exists for the
next round rather than for the verifier.

```markdown
## Round <n>, step <2|4a|4a-s|4b|7>

Reviewer output: <path>. Dispositions and evidence: `findings-<slug>.md`.

- F<n>: <the reasoning, in your own words: why it holds, why it does not, or why it can wait>
```

**Identifiers and reasoning only.** The verdict, the critique and the proof already exist in the
reviewer's own output and in the register, so copying them here builds a second resolution record that
can disagree with the first. The register's disposition vocabulary stays out too: its `ACCEPTED` means a
finding left unfixed with a rationale, and a log line labelled the same way would read as the opposite.
Point at both files and write the WHY neither has a column for.

**Write at EVERY adjudication, terminal ones included.** Step 2's verdict is adjudicated when it returns,
long before step 5, and the step 3 implementer is a fresh dispatch that needs the reasoning behind the
brief it is handed. Step 5 writes the 4a, 4a-s, 4b and 4c rounds. Step 7 is terminal and writes its own
round when it returns, because the log is what step 8 reads when it files the tasks.

**Read the existing entries before EVERY agent brief and EVERY retry**, meaning before dispatching steps
3, 4a, 4a-s, 4b, 6 and 7, and before a reviewer retry after a failed run. Every one of them is a FRESH
dispatch that remembers nothing: sol runs read-only in a new session, Fable is reached by inheritance,
and neither has seen the round before. A retry is the sharpest case, since the run it replaces argued
something nobody else recorded. Skip the read and step 7 re-litigates round one.

## Filing step 8's tasks

Every open finding becomes a task; nothing is demoted to a comment. Filing one also requires a
scheduling decision at the moment it is written: can it wait, or must it land now, and say which in the
task. Fan-out, not throughput, is what stalls a plan, so a finding on shipped and working code is
normally scheduled out.

**A finding on this UNMERGED pull request may still take `TASK #<n>`, and that is what makes this
loop open.** A line being in this diff does not by itself force the fix into this round. If it did,
nothing could ever reach step 8: every in-scope finding anchors to a line this slice added or
changed, and out-of-scope findings never enter the register at all, so the two rules together would
leave the register with no row that can defer, and this strategy would be closed-loop wearing another
name.

**These BLOCK the merge and are fixed in this round, never deferred:**

- The slice does not do what its brief says, or does it wrongly. A correctness defect in the
  behaviour this slice shipped is what the round is for.
- Any finding from step 4a-s, the security lens, at any severity.
- A test-quality finding that leaves the slice's own evidence unsound: an assertion that cannot fail,
  a mutant recorded as SURVIVED, a sweep with no unmutated control.
- A regression against `origin/main`: anything that worked before this diff and does not after it.
- A pre-existing defect this slice WIDENS, up to the widening. The remedy is the smallest change that
  restores the pre-slice blast radius, and it lands here.

**Every other in-scope finding MAY take `TASK #<n>`**, with its scheduling decision written into the
task: a code-quality finding ranked below correctness, hardening that goes further than restoring the
pre-slice blast radius, a naming or structure improvement, a broader test the slice's own evidence
does not need. Defer one only when nobody reading `main` tomorrow is misled or harmed by it shipping
today.

Either way, adjudicate at step 5 first: reproduce the finding before accepting it. A deferred row
still needs its number in the `--tasks` manifest, or the gate fails.

## What this strategy does NOT do

- It does not force every finding into this PR. Step 8 exists, so a finding may legitimately leave as a
  task. Under the other two strategies it may not, and the register mechanically refuses.
- It does not skip step 7. The fix gets an independent re-review, exactly once, never a loop.
- It has no step 6v. Terminal verification belongs to [closed-loop](../closed-loop/SKILL.md), which has
  no step 7 to do that job.
- It does not let a review run unbounded over the repository.

## The siblings

- [closed-loop](../closed-loop/SKILL.md): every finding feeds back into the same iteration and is fixed
  there. Nothing is deferred and nothing is planned for later. Pick it when the task was created by
  step 4a, 4b or 7.
- [orchestrator-loop](../orchestrator-loop/SKILL.md): the orchestrator is inside the loop, writing the
  failing tests and the seams itself instead of briefing an implementer. It is closed-loop in the
  findings sense as well, so the three names do not sit on one axis. Pick it when the behaviour can be
  stated as a test before it can be stated as a paragraph.
